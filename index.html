            I started programming early on making various games in Game Maker Studio.
            That led to me making various games that eventually lead to nothing happening over and over,
            I eventually swapped over to the Unity game engine and continued doing so until I eventually gave up
            and took a 2 year break. Eventually, I decided to pick up game development yet again 
            and that led to me developing the passion for programming I have today. Shortly after 
            that I decided to take learning seriously and have since been taking the CS50: Intro to computer science course,
            As well as self studying and attempting to build by working towards finishing an indie game to call my own.
